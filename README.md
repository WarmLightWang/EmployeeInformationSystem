# Employee Information System
 Employee Information System (EIS) uses a Java-based CLI front end that connects to a postgreSQL database with JDBC. EIS will manage the process of operating employees' information. After accessing a database, EIS provides multiple functions to interact between the CLI and database. We can add new employees, remove an employee, and browse all employees' information. Also, we can check,  change, or update any specific information in the database from this system.
